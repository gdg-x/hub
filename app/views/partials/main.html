              Google Developer Groups (GDGs) are for developers who are interested in Google's developer technology; everything from the Android, App Engine, and Google Chrome platforms, to product APIs like the Maps API, YouTube API and Google Calendar API.<br/><br/>
              A GDG can take many forms -- from just a few people getting together to watch our <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/GoogleDevelopers">latest video</a>, to large gatherings with demos and tech talks, to events like code sprints and hackathons. However, at the core, GDGs are focused on developers and technical content, and the core audience should be developers.

                <li>15th Sep - 31st Oct 2014</li>
                <li>1st Oct - 30th Nov 2014</li>

              <p>
                Each GDG DevFest will be inspired by and uniquely tailored to the needs of the developer community that hosts it. 
                While no two events will be exactly alike, each GDG DevFest will, at its core, be powered by a shared belief 
                that when developers come together to exchange ideas, amazing things can happen.
              </p>
              <p>
                GDG DevFests can be organized year round and are community run events. Therefore, these events take the form desired by the community with minimal guidelines. In order to ensure these events are bigger than regular GDG meetups though, there are a few recommendations:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Duration of the event should be at least 5 hours</li>
                <li>More than 1 track if organizing a speaker session based event</li>
                <li>Hackathon (Single or Multi Product) - Ideally somewhere between 24-48 hours</li>
                <li>Product days - Multiple-day event with one product each day are also suggested</li>
              </ul>
